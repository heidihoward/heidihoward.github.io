#### About Me

I am a Senior Researcher in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/confidential-computing/">Confidential Computing group</a> at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/">Microsoft Research Cambridge</a>. My research sits at the intersection between the theory and practice of distributed computing, with a focus on developing resilient and trustworthy distributed computer systems. Previously, I was a Research Fellow in Computer Science at Cambridge University’s <a href="https://www.trinhall.cam.ac.uk">Trinity Hall</a>, an Affiliated/Visiting Researcher at <a href="https://research.vmware.com">VMware Research</a>, and an Affiliated Lecturer at Cambridge University’s <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk">Department of Computer Science and Technology</a>. I received my Ph.D. from Cambridge University in 2019 for my <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-935.pdf">research on Distributed Consensus</a> and I am probably best known for my work on the Paxos algorithm, and in particular, the invention of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06696">Flexible Paxos</a>.
